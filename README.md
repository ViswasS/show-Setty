# Hi! This is Viswas performing WebApps lab02
## One of my most favorite foods: Hyderabadi-Dum Biryani
I love Hyderabadi-Dum Biryani because it is a perfect combination of **aromatic spices** and is a **dish of celebration**.
This dish comes into play during various occasions and the slow cooking process is what gives the dish a more flavorful and aromatic taste.

## Places I can get
1. **Home-made** : Although it is a little hard to match as similarly as a hotel dish, it can be made in our homes.
2. **Pista House** : In Hyderabad, It is a must try dish at Pista House.
3. **Naidu gari Kunda Biryani** : It is served in a clay pot.

- The three side dishes i would have with are
- Kaju mutton
- Raitha
- Omlette
